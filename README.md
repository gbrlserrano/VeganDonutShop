# Vegan Donut Shop 
*(building a websites for beginners)*

This repository was created from Brad Hussey's class "Build Websites from Scratch with HTML & CSS" at Udemy,
using a fictional donut shop to improve knowledge and practicing some good CSS and HTML5 content :joy:

*the javaScript code there was just to adapt the code to old browsers using the Modernizr*

> **Modernizr is a small piece of JavaScript code that automatically detects the availability of next-generation web technologies in your user's browsers. Rather than blacklisting entire ranges of browsers based on “UA sniffing,” Modernizr uses feature detection to allow you to easily tailor your user's experiences based on the actual capabilities of their browser.**
